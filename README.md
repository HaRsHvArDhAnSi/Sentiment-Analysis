Task 2 from Code Clause: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This repository contains the code for Task 2 from Code Clause, which focuses on implementing a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression. The project aims to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories based on the content of the text.

üìÅ Dataset:
The project utilizes two datasets: "Reddit_Data.csv" and "Twitter_Data.csv". These datasets contain text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels. The data preprocessing involves lowercasing, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

üîß Model Training:
The sentiment analysis model is trained using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectors as input features. The model learns sentiment patterns in the text data to make accurate predictions. To optimize performance, hyperparameters are fine-tuned, and convergence issues are addressed.

üéØ Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The accuracy score is measured to assess the overall sentiment classification accuracy. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's predictions and identify misclassifications.

üí° Key Skills:

Text preprocessing techniques
TF-IDF vectorization
Sentiment analysis with Logistic Regression
Model hyperparameter tuning
Model evaluation and performance metrics
This project provides a practical implementation of sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression. The code and implementation can serve as a learning resource for sentiment analysis tasks.
