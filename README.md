Task 2 from Code Clause: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This repository contains the code for Task 2 from Code Clause, which focuses on implementing a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression. The project aims to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories based on the content of the text.

üìÅ Dataset: The project utilizes two datasets: "Reddit_Data.csv" and "Twitter_Data.csv". These datasets contain text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels. The data preprocessing involves lowercasing, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

üîß Model Training: The sentiment analysis model is trained using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectors as input features. The model learns sentiment patterns in the text data to make accurate predictions. To optimize performance, hyperparameters are fine-tuned, and convergence issues are addressed.

üéØ Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The accuracy score is measured to assess the overall sentiment classification accuracy. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's predictions and identify misclassifications.

üìä Graph Visualization: The code also includes the generation of a confusion matrix graph using matplotlib. The confusion matrix graph provides a visual representation of the model's predictions. The graph is displayed using the imshow function from the pyplot module. The x-axis and y-axis represent the predicted and true sentiment categories, respectively. The intensity of color in each cell of the graph indicates the number of samples classified in each category.
