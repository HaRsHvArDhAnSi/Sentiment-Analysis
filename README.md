📚 Welcome to Task 2 of Code Clause on GitHub! 🚀 This repository contains my implementation 🐍 of sentiment analysis using Python. I successfully completed the task by analyzing sentiment in text from the datasets 📂 "Reddit_Data.csv" and "Twitter_Data.csv". The code showcases advanced data preprocessing techniques 🧠 and TF-IDF text vectorization 📝. Through the utilization of a powerful Logistic Regression model 📈, I achieved accurate sentiment classification. This project highlights my proficiency in natural language processing and machine learning, demonstrating my ability to tackle real-world tasks effectively. Let's dive into the fascinating world of sentiment analysis together! 🌟💬
